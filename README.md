# blender-Basics
This repo consists basic blender projects which are created while am learning simple blender tools.



In this repo I have 5 main basic projects.

- Introduction 
- My Room
- Mayan Pyramid
- Bowling
- Low Poly Chess

In introduction file I'm taking my first steps those are just very basic blender files which I use edit mode for first time.

My Room is a project where I try to model my room with just  moving, scaling and rotating.

Mayan Pyramid project is the project where I learn and practice; snapping, extruding, loop cut, array modifiers. In addition I also learned about normals, insetting and subdividing.

In Bowling blender file, I imported a reference material for the first time. I used spin and bevel tools. I also used extruding tool to a normal.

In Low Poly Chess, I learned about appending, parents and children, lighting, roughness amd textures.
